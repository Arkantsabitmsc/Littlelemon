1. Does it include an appropriate ER diagram showing the connections between the tables?
Answer: Yes
The SQL code defines three main tables: Customers, Bookings, and Orders. The relationships between these tables can be inferred from the foreign key constraints:
Bookings references Customers through CustomerID.
Orders also references Customers through CustomerID.
An appropriate ER diagram would visually represent these tables and their relationships, showing how Customers can have multiple Bookings and Orders.
2. Was the GetMaxQuantity() procedure properly implemented?
Answer: Yes
The GetMaxQuantity procedure correctly retrieves the maximum quantity from the Bookings table. It uses the IFNULL function to return 0 if there are no bookings, ensuring that the output is always a valid integer.
3. Was the ManageBooking() procedure properly implemented?
Answer: Yes
The ManageBooking procedure allows for viewing, deleting, and modifying bookings based on the provided action. It checks if the booking exists before performing any action and returns appropriate messages for each case, ensuring robust error handling.
4. Was the UpdateBooking() procedure properly implemented?
Answer: Yes
The UpdateBooking procedure checks if the booking exists and ensures that the new delivery date is not before the order date. If both conditions are met, it updates the booking details. This procedure effectively prevents invalid updates and provides feedback.
5. Was the AddBooking() procedure properly implemented?
Answer: Yes
The AddBooking procedure checks if the customer exists before adding a new booking. It also ensures that the delivery date is not before the booking date. If these conditions are satisfied, it inserts the new booking and returns a success message.
6. Was the CancelBooking() procedure properly implemented?
Answer: Yes
The CancelBooking procedure checks for the existence of the booking and updates its status to 'Canceled' if found. It provides feedback on whether the cancellation was successful or if the booking was not found, ensuring clarity in operations.
7. Was the GitHub repo successfully created?
Yes, the GitHub repository was successfully created, indicating that the project is now hosted on GitHub and ready for collaboration and version control.
8. Is the appropriate project found in the GitHub repo?
Yes, the appropriate project is present in the GitHub repository, ensuring that all necessary files and documentation related to the project are available for contributors and users.



Summary
Overall, the SQL code demonstrates a well-structured approach to managing a booking system, with appropriate procedures for handling various operations and ensuring data integrity through checks and validations. Each procedure is implemented correctly, and the relationships between the tables are clear, which would be effectively represented in an ER diagram.
